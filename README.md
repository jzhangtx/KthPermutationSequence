Kth Permutation Sequence


Given two integers n and k, find the kth permutation sequence of numbers from 1 to n.

The numbers from 1 to n has n! unique permutations.

For n=3, the permutations in order are:

“123”
“132”
“213”
“231”
“312”
“321”
The 4th permutation is “231”.

Testing
Input Format
The first line contains an integer ‘T’, denoting the number of test cases.

For each test case, a line containing space-separated integers ‘n’ and ‘k’.

Output Format
For each test case, print the kth permutation in a separate line.

Sample Input
2
4 3
3 4
Expected Output
1324
231
